This repository contains [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for use by the [Synapse team](https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/teams/synapse-core).

The intent is to keep our various projects' CI configuration consistent without having to update N yaml files across N repositories.
